# Brain Stroke Analysis and Prediction
The main objective of this project is to develop multiple machine-learning models to analyze the factors that are causing brain strokes in modern society. A brain stroke, as we know it, occurs suddenly, and may sometimes even cause death. It comes so unprecedented that it is difficult to identify the exact root cause for the issue sometimes. This brain condition occurs in all age groups irrespective of their physical and mental health. We wanted to build a system that analyzes some of the most prominent factors that might be a reason for the stroke to occur. We scouted the internet to get as much data as possible which is closer to our idea. We wanted to analyze physical features like Height, weight, BMI, gender, age, etc. along with other attributes like Marital status, type of work, and place of living. We successfully found one dataset which has all the necessary details mentioned above and started working on the data. The insights we got after analyzing the data were eye-opening and they revealed a lot of crucial information regarding stroke occurrences. As we go further into the in-depth analysis of the data, we figured out that a lot of factors are intertwined with each other, and their combination is sometimes even more dangerous. More information is provided as we dive deep into the analysis. We have taken the Machine Learning life cycle approach to handling this project.
